# Word List

ZWORDLE uses the list of 5-letter words found here: [https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt)

# Word Score

[Marc Bernard](https://github.com/mbtools) added a feature to "score" words based on the letter Frequency for English Dictionary Words.
See: [Source of Letter Frequency for English Dictionary Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency)
